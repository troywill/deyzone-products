<p>Easy-to-use, self-contained boresighting system fits in the
chamber of your rifle or pistol and projects a powerful red laser
beam aligned with the bore axis for sighting to the point-of-aim
without firing a shot.</p>
<p>Works with scopes, holographic red dot sights. Durable, machined
brass housing looks like a cartridge case but actually contains the
entire laser system and batteries.</p>
<p>Insert the batteries and screw the cap on the housing to turn on
the laser; remove the batteries to turn off. Insert the entire
assembly into the chamber, gently close the action, and aim at a
target 20-30 yards away. Adjust windage and elevation of the scope
or sights so point-of-aim is zeroed on.</p>
