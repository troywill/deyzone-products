<p>Designed for all thread arrows. This item gives you the ability
to fine tune arrow sights without shooting an arrow. No more losing
or damaging arrows. Hit the target with your first shot! This unit
mounts directly to your arrow by using the threads in the insert. A
very straight arrow and spin tester must be used to achieve perfect
alignment of the laser beam and the arrow shaft before the unit can
be used.</p>
<p>Includes arrow, laser aiming device, and batteries.</p>
